## Chapter 1

Clara is an interstellar traveler with a weird spaceship that looks like a blue box. She decides to visit all $7$ stars in the Big Dipper (suppose there's only $7$ stars) in a week, visiting one star each day. How many ways can she plan her journey?



## Chapter 2

Timmie raises ducks and pigeons in his backyard. He has $7$ ducks and $10$ pigeons. 

Today he randomly picks $5$ fowls from his backyard. What's the probability that all $5$ are ducks?



## Chapter 3

A TV show I watched is sponsored by [a beverage brand](https://kamenrider.fandom.com/wiki/Oronamin_C). During commercial breaks, there's always advertisements of the drink with actors from the show. I want to know if the commercials are really effective, so I randomly surveyed some people. I found that $30\%$ of them have watched the show, and $50\%$ of people who watched bought products from the brand. Also, for those people who didn't watch, $10\%$ of them bought products from the brand. (Data made up by me)

Suppose the sample group is representative of the whole population. What's the probability that a person has watched the show given that the person bought from the brand?



## Chapter 4

Many popular video games (like [Genshin Impact](https://genshin.hoyoverse.com/)) has a "gacha" system, which allows players to exchange in-game currency for a random item in game, including characters, weapons, cards, etc. Each exchange is called a "roll".

Andy is playing such a game, and there's a character that he really wants. It's said in the game that the probability of getting this character is $0.01$, and he still wants to try his luck. Andy decides that he'll continue rolling until he gets the character. What's the probability that he makes 100 rolls?
