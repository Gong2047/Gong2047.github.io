## Axions of Probability

* Starts with an <u>Experiment</u> that generates a set of all possible outcomes - <u>Sample Space</u>: S (The Universal set in this experiment). 
* Any subset $A\sub S$ is called event.

Truths: 

* For any $A \sub S$:
    * $A\cup A^c = S$
    * $AA^c = \O$

#### Examples

* Experiment: Flip $3$ coins
    * Sample Space: $S = \{HHH, HHT, HTH, THH, TTT, TTH, THT, HTT\}$
    * Size of $S$:  $|S| = 8$ 
* Flip 4 Coins
    * $S = \{......\}$
    * $|S| = 2^4 = 16$
* Roll $2$ distinguishable dice 
    * $S = \{...\}$
    * $|S| = 36$
