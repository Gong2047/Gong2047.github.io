## Motivating Examples

1. The set of integers $\Z$, we have addition defined on it: $a+b$

    * Associative: $(a+b)+c = a+(b+c)$

    * Commutative: $a+b=b+a$

    * $0\in \Z$. such that $a+0=0+a=a$ for any $a\in \Z$.

    * $\forall a \in \Z$, it has an "inverse": $-a \in \Z$ 

        such that $a+(-a)=(-a)+a=0$

2. The set of $n\times n$ invertible matrices with $\R-entries$

    * **Denoted** by $GL_n(\R)$ 
    * On $GL_n(\mathbb{R})$, a matrix multiplication can be defined.
        * $GL_n(\R)\times GL_n(\R) \rightarrow GL_n(\mathbb{R})$
        * $(A,B)\mapsto AB$
    
    > Note that $AB \in $ $GL_n(\mathbb{R})$ since $A$ and $B$ invertible $\Rightarrow$ $AB$ invertible.
    >
    > $|A| = 0, |B| = 0,$ so $|AB| = |A||B|=0$ 
    
    * Associative: $(AB)C=A(BC)$
    
    * Commutative: Holds only when $n=1$. 
    
        * In general we know $AB \ne BA$
    
    * Identity Matrix :
    
      $$
      I = \begin{bmatrix}
        1 & ... & ...\\
        ... & 1 & ...\\
        ...&...&1
        \end{bmatrix}
      $$
    
        * $\forall A \in GL_n(\mathbb{R}), IA = AI = A$
        * $\forall A \in GL_n(\mathbb{R})$, it has inverse matrix $A^{-1}$, $AA^{-1} = A^{-1}A = I$

## Group

### Definition

* A Group is a nonempty set $G$ with an operation (also called Law of Composition) on it.
    * $G\times G \rightarrow G$ (means an operation, not necessarily multiplication)
    * $(g_1,g_2)\mapsto g_1g_2$
* It satisfies the conditions below
    * Associative: $\forall x,y,z \in G, (xy)z=x(yz)$
    * $\exists 1 \in G, \quad \forall g\in G, \quad 1\cdot g = g\cdot 1 = g$. ($1$ is called the identity)
    * $\forall g \in G, $     $\exists g^{-1}\in G$,     $gg^{-1} = g^{-1}g = 1$. ($g^{-1}$ is called the inverse of $g$)
*  If a groups is also commutative (i.e. $\forall g_1, g_2 \in G, g_1h_2 = g_2g_1$), then we say it's an <u>**abelian group**</u> (named after Abel)
* We see the two motivating examples are groups
* Remarks on notation:
    * $e$ is also often used to denote identity
    * If $G$ is abelian, we can use $0$ for identity and $+$ for composition
    * In general, the composition is usually denoted by $ab$, $a\cdot b$, $a*b$, ...

### Example of Groups:

1. The trivial group: $G = \{1\}$

    * Composition: $1 \cdot 1 = 1$

2. $\mathbb{R}^x = \mathbb{R}-\{0\}$ with <u>multiplication</u> is a group.

    * Set: the real number except 0
    * Law of Composition: multiplication
    * Associative: $(ab)c=a(bc)$
    * identity: $1 \in \mathbb{R}^x:$   $\forall a \in \mathbb{R}^x$,   $a\cdot 1 = 1\cdot a = a$
    * inverse: $\forall a \in \mathbb{R}^x$,   $a \frac{1}{a} = \frac1aa = 1$

    > We delete 0 because 0 doesn't have an inverse.

    * Furthermore, $\mathbb{R}^x$ is an abelian group.

3. Let $S$ be a set of $n$ elements. Say $S = \{1, 2,... n\}$

    Let $G$ be the set of all bijections on $S$. Each element is a function $S \rightarrow S$.

    Then $G$ with the function composition forms a group:
    $$
    G \times G \rightarrow G\\
    (f_1,f_2) \mapsto f_1 \circ  f_2
    $$

    > Note that $f_1\circ f_2$ is also bijective, so it's in $G$.

    * associative: $(f_1\circ f_2)\circ f_3 = f_1\circ (f_2\circ f_3)$
    * identity: identity function $id_s$
        * $\forall f \in G$,    $f\circ id_s = id_s \circ f = f$
    * inverse: $\forall f \in G,$ its invers function $f^{-1}$ is its inverse:
        * $f\circ f^{-1} = f^{-1}\circ f = id_s$

    **Remarks**:

    * We will use $S_n$ to denote this group. 
    * Called the <u>symmetric groups</u> or <u>permutation group</u>.

### Theorems

* <u>**Theorem**</u>: In a group $G$, the identity is unique

    Proof: 
    * If 1, 1' are both identities of $G$, then $1 = 1\cdot 1' = 1'$ 


> Inverse of $g\in G$ is also unique



* **<u>Theorem</u>** (<u>Cancellation Law</u>):  If $G$ is a group, $x,y,z\in G$, the $xy = xz \Rightarrow y=z$

    Proof: 
    $$
    xy = xz\\
    x^{-1}(xy) = x^{-1}(xz)\\
    (x^{-1}x)y = (x^{-1}x)z\\
    1\cdot y = 1\cdot z\\
    y = z
    $$

> **NOTE**: $\mathbb{R}$ with multiplication is ==NOT== a group. 
> 
> * Because $0\in \mathbb{R}$ has no inverse, cancellation law is not true on $\mathbb{R}$
>     * Ex: $x(x-1) = 2x$
> 
> * On the other hand, $\mathbb{R}$ with addition is a group, so cancellation law holds.
>     * $a+b =a+c\quad \Rightarrow\quad b=c$
