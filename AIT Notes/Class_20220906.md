##  Node and Json

* Use Const or Let to declare variables

    * block level scope (between `{}` )
    * Can't declare variable after usage
    * Can't reassign when you use const
    * If you const declare you must assign to a value
        * const foo; //won't work

* Ways to create arrays

    * `let arr = [2, true, 'two']`
    * `arr = Array(2, 3, 4)`
        * this gives you an array [2, 3, 4]
        * Note that if you type `Array(2)`, it gives you an array of 2 empty items

* Destructuring

    * Multiple Assignment:
    * `let [a, b] = [2, 3]`// a=2, b=3

* 3 kinds of for loop
  
    ```javascript
    for(let i = 0; i< arr.length; i++){
        console.log(arr[i])
    }
    
    for (const element of arr){
        console.log(element)
    }
    
    arr.forEach(console.log)
    ```
    * Which to use?
    
    * the regular for loop is faster.
    
    * the for of is more readable
    
* Use or not use semicolon is just a choice of style. 

* Functions are just an objects. A way to create a function is to use the `function` key word and assign it to a variable.

    ```javaScript
    const f = function(x) {
        return x + 1
    }
    
    console.log(typeof f) 
    // will print 'function'
    ```

    ```javascript
    const arr = [1, 2, 3]
    
    arr.forEach(function(x) { console.log(x + 1) })
    // will print 2 3 4
    ```
    The part `function(x) { console.log(x + 1) }` is an example of an anonymous function.

### Hoisting

* Hoisting （变量提升）：

    When you declare a function using the keyword function and give it a name immediately, the function declaration and its body was actually brought to the top of the file. That means you can do this:

    ```javascript
    printInc(3)
    
    function printInc(x) {
        console.log(x + 1)
    }
    // will print 4
    ```

* 变量提升也适用于其他数据类型和变量。变量可以在声明之前进行初始化和使用。但是如果没有初始化，就不能使用它们。
* 函数和变量相比，会被优先提升。这意味着函数会被提升到更靠前的位置。
* JavaScript 只会提升声明，不会提升其初始化。如果一个变量先被使用再被声明和赋值的话，使用时的值是 undefined。

### Ways of declaring functions

* Hoisting won't work if you use `const` to define a function, because `const` and `let` are not hoisted.

    ```javaScript
    inc(3)
    
    const inc = function(x) {
        console.log(x + 1)
    }
    // error
    ```

* We can also use arrow to declare functions, in the format `parameters => body`. There's an implicit return, it'll automatically return the result of the body, so we don't need to add a return statement.

    ```javascript
    //this is an anonymous function
    x => console.log(x + 1)
    
    //giving it a name
    const inc = x => console.log(x + 1)
    
    arr.forEach(inc) // will print 2 3 4
    ```

    We can also accept multiple parameters

    ```javascript
    const add = (a, b) => a + b
    console.log(add(5, 5)) // prints 10
    ```

    If we want multiple lines of body, we need to put them in curly braces. Also we need to add a return.

    ```javascript
    const add = (a, b) => {
        return a + b
    }
    console.log(add(5, 5)) // prints 10
    ```

    * Advantages:
        * No hoisting
        * More terse (concise), shorter to write
    * Side effects:
        * don't have  `this`
    * Don't use arrow functions as event handlers.
    * Don't use when creating methods.
    
* Summary: Ways of declaring functions:

    ```javascript
    // 1. Function declaration
    function f() {
        
    }
    
    // 2. Constant declaring and set it equal to a function expression
    const f = ......(one of the following two)
    	//arrow function
    const f = x => x+1
    	//anonymous function
    const f = function(x) {return x+1}
    
    // 3. Anonymous functions
    ```

### Event Handler


* What is an event handler?

    * Node.js is a "server" side JavaScript -- runtime + framework(networking, file io, process management)

    * it's different from a browser JavaScript

        * Document (html)
        * worker management
        * local storage in browser

    * Typically, in node your app is a "single process" (blocking)

        * All io is non-blocking / Asynchronous

        * ```javascript
            const request = require('request');
            console.log("Start");
            request('http://www.google.com', function (error, response, body) {
                //just print out the first 30 characters of the response body
                console.log(body.slice(0,30))
            })
            console.log("Done!");
            // Will print "Start" and "Done" first, then the html
            ```

        * the function is a callback function.

            `function (error,response,body) {
                console.log(body.slice(0,30))
            }`

            This means that it's not immediately invoked. 
            
            it's called when the request function finishes.

    * io: 

        * reading a file
        * writing a file
        * read/write from a database
        * requesting from network

    * These are all asynchronous, because we don't know how long it's going to take, so we just continue to the next line.

* Therefore, we need an event handler to let us know when the io (reading or writing is finished)

    * In this case,

        `function (error,response,body) {
            console.log(body.slice(0,30))
        }`

* BTW, another way of dealing with async in io is the function `async` and `await`.

    * `await` do the block for you, and the rest of you app can still run.
    * One of the older ways

### Functions as parameters


* Functions as parameters
    * Example:

        ```javascript
        const arr = [1,2,3]
        
        arr.forEach(console.log) //prints 一串很怪的东西
        // Note that console.log() is also a call back function here
        
        arr.map(x => x * 2) //returns [2,4,6]
        ```

    * Note that we can pass functions as arguments, either using already defined functions or anonymous functions.


### Default value of parameter


* Set default value in function declaration
    * `foo(a, b, c='default'){}`
    * If you don't pass enough parameters in JavaScript, it'll just treat the rest as undefined.

### Spread operator


* Array methods 
    * The `...` operator  
    * rest operator
        * It'll consider the arguments as an array
    
        ```javascript
        function foo(...args) {
            console.log(args)
        }
        foo(1,2,3)      //prints [1,2,3]
        foo(1,2,3,4,5)  //prints [1,2,3,4,5]
        ```
    
    * spread operator
        * Takes elements of an array and puts it as positional arguments
        * `parseInt('number', radix)` 
    
        ```javascript
        parseInt('100')             // 100
        parseInt('100', 2)          // 4
        
        const arr = ['100', 2]
        
        parseInt(arr)               // 100
        parseInt(arr[0],arr[1])     // 4
        parseInt(...arr)            // 4
        // ... is the spread operator
        ```

        * Also works with arrays. 
        * Instead of `concat` we can use it to combine two arrays.
    
        ```javascript
        const arr = ['100', 2]
        const arr2 = [300,400]
        
        console.log([...arr, ...arr2])
        //['100', 2, 300, 400]
        
        console.log(['wat', ...arr, ...arr2])
        //['wat','100', 2, 300, 400]
        ```


## Packages and Modules

### NPM

* npm:
    * The actual command line tool to install packages / modules
    * the repository where these modules are listed
* alternatives to npm
    * yarn
    * pnpm
    
* `package.json` = meta info (project name, version, dependencies, dev deps, etc.)
    * generated on npm install
    * generated on npm init
* `package-lock.json` = exact tree of deps for your project
    * generated on npm install
   
* `dependencies `and `devDependencies` difference
    * `devDependencies` are things that your app doesn't depend on, but your development process does.

* npm allows installation of 
    * modules 
    * command line tools
    * these are typically server side
* NPM does allow installation of frontend library, but they don't work on server (in node context) necessarily.
    * some modules like `Next.js` blurs the line

* npx
    * runs what you installed
    * execute it without having to go into the node nodules folder
    * automatically installed
